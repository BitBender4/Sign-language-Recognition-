# Sign-language-Recognition-
ðŸ§  Sign Language Recognition using OpenCV & Deep Learning

This project recognizes American Sign Language (ASL) hand gestures in real time using a webcam. It uses OpenCV for hand detection and preprocessing, and a trained TensorFlow/Keras model for classification. The goal is to build an assistive tool for the deaf and hard of hearing community by converting sign language gestures into readable text.
